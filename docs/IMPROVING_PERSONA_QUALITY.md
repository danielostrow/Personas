# Improving Persona Quality - Advanced Guide

This guide covers techniques to make your persona LoRAs capture more realistic features and produce higher-quality results.

## üéØ Current Analysis

Your current setup:
- **38 training images** (good quantity)
- **Network dims**: 64/32 (moderate)
- **Learning rate**: 1e-4 (a bit high)
- **Training steps**: 8000 (likely over-training)
- **LoRA strength**: 0.8/0.8 (high)

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. **Training Configuration Optimization**

#### Increase Network Dimensions
Higher dimensions capture more detailed features:

```toml
[additional_network_arguments]
network_module = "networks.lora"
network_dim = 128        # Increased from 64
network_alpha = 64       # Increased from 32
```

#### Lower Learning Rate for Fine Details
```toml
[optimizer_arguments]
learning_rate = 5e-5     # Reduced from 1e-4
lr_scheduler = "cosine_with_restarts"
lr_warmup_steps = 200    # Reduced warmup
```

#### Optimize Training Steps
With 38 images √ó 10 repeats = 380 steps/epoch:
```toml
[training_arguments]
max_train_steps = 3000   # Reduced from 8000 (about 8 epochs)
save_every_n_epochs = 2  # More frequent saves
```

### 2. **Training Data Quality**

#### Image Diversity Requirements
- **Angles**: Front, 3/4 left, 3/4 right, profile
- **Expressions**: Neutral, smiling, serious, surprised
- **Lighting**: Natural, studio, dramatic, soft
- **Distances**: Close-up, medium shot, full body
- **Backgrounds**: Various (will be learned out with good captions)

#### Image Quality Standards
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1024px on shortest side
- **Sharpness**: In-focus, not blurry
- **Lighting**: Well-lit face, avoid shadows on eyes
- **Cropping**: Face should be 30-70% of image

### 3. **Advanced Captioning Strategy**

#### Detailed Caption Format
Instead of: `"persona-saramillie, woman"`

Use: `"persona-saramillie, young woman with [hair color] hair, [expression], [lighting description], [angle description]"`

Examples:
```
persona-saramillie, young woman with brown hair, slight smile, natural lighting, three-quarter view
persona-saramillie, professional woman, serious expression, studio lighting, front facing portrait
persona-saramillie, woman with flowing hair, laughing, golden hour lighting, profile view
```

### 4. **Generation Optimization**

#### LoRA Strength Testing
Try different strengths for different effects:

- **0.6-0.7**: More subtle, natural integration
- **0.8-0.9**: Strong persona features (current)
- **1.0+**: Maximum strength (may overfit)

#### Advanced Prompting
```
# Strong identity preservation
"masterpiece, professional portrait of persona-saramillie, detailed facial features, sharp focus, studio lighting, 85mm lens, highly detailed skin texture"

# More natural/candid
"candid photo of persona-saramillie, natural lighting, slight smile, relaxed expression, photorealistic"

# Specific scenarios
"persona-saramillie as a business executive, confident expression, modern office background, professional attire"
```

## üîß Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Retrain with Better Settings

1. **Create optimized config**:
```bash
# Generate new training config with better settings
python scripts/create_optimized_config.py --persona-id persona-saramillie
```

2. **Retrain the LoRA**:
```bash
./scripts/train_lora.sh persona-saramillie 5e-5 3000
```

### Step 2: Test Multiple LoRA Strengths

Create workflows with different strengths:
```bash
# Generate test workflows
python scripts/create_strength_test_workflows.py --persona-id persona-saramillie
```

### Step 3: Improve Training Data (Optional)

Add more diverse training images:
```bash
# Process additional images
python scripts/prepare_training_data.py --persona-id persona-saramillie --target-size 1024

# Generate better captions
python scripts/generate_captions.py --persona-id persona-saramillie --mode detailed \
  --suffix "photorealistic, detailed facial features"
```

## üìä Quality Metrics

### Good Results Indicators
- ‚úÖ Consistent facial features across generations
- ‚úÖ Natural-looking integration with scene
- ‚úÖ Proper lighting and shadows
- ‚úÖ Sharp, detailed facial features
- ‚úÖ Expressions look natural

### Poor Results Indicators
- ‚ùå Blurry or distorted features
- ‚ùå Inconsistent face structure
- ‚ùå Over-processed/artificial look
- ‚ùå Wrong facial features appearing
- ‚ùå Artifacts around face/hair

## üé® Advanced Techniques

### Multiple LoRA Training
Train specialized LoRAs for different scenarios:
- **Portrait LoRA**: Close-up facial features (50+ portrait images)
- **Full-body LoRA**: Body proportions and posture (30+ full-body images)
- **Expression LoRA**: Emotional range (varied expressions)

### Negative Embeddings
Create negative embeddings to avoid unwanted features:
```bash
# Train negative embedding for common artifacts
python scripts/train_negative_embedding.py --name "bad-saramillie-features"
```

### Custom Sampling Settings
Optimize generation parameters:
- **Steps**: 30-50 (more for complex scenes)
- **CFG Scale**: 6-8 (lower for more natural look)
- **Sampler**: DPM++ 2M or Euler A
- **Scheduler**: Karras or Normal

## üîÑ Iterative Improvement Process

1. **Generate test batch** (20-30 images)
2. **Evaluate quality** using metrics above
3. **Identify weak points** (lighting, angles, expressions)
4. **Adjust parameters** (LoRA strength, prompts, etc.)
5. **Retrain if needed** with better data/settings
6. **Repeat** until satisfied

## üìù Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Retrain with optimized settings
./scripts/train_lora.sh persona-saramillie 5e-5 3000

# Test different LoRA strengths
python persona_gen.py create-workflow --persona-id persona-saramillie --type image --lora-strength 0.7

# Generate high-quality captions
python scripts/generate_captions.py --persona-id persona-saramillie --mode detailed

# Create strength comparison workflow
python scripts/create_comparison_workflow.py --persona-id persona-saramillie
```

Remember: **Quality over quantity** - it's better to have fewer high-quality, diverse training images than many similar ones.

## üîç **Advanced Validation Workflows**

For ultra-realistic results, use the specialized validation workflows:

### **Simple Validation (Recommended Start)**
```bash
# Creates workflow with 2 methods + upscaling
python scripts/create_simple_validation_workflow.py --persona-id persona-saramillie --lora-strength 0.7
```

**Features:**
- Conservative vs Alternative sampling methods
- Photorealistic prompting
- 2x upscaling with RealESRGAN
- 4 output versions for comparison

### **Advanced Validation (Maximum Quality)**
```bash
# Creates workflow with 3 methods + comprehensive validation
python scripts/create_advanced_validation_workflow.py --persona-id persona-saramillie --lora-strength 0.65
```

**Features:**
- Triple sampling method comparison
- Ultra-realistic professional photography prompts
- Comprehensive AI artifact prevention
- 6 output versions with detailed upscaling
- Professional photography simulation (Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens)

### **Validation Workflow Usage**

1. **Load validation workflow** in ComfyUI
2. **Run once** - generates multiple candidate images
3. **Compare all versions** side-by-side
4. **Select most realistic version** 
5. **Note the best method** for future generations
6. **Adjust LoRA strength** if needed (try 0.6, 0.65, 0.7)

### **Quality Assessment Checklist**

Rate each generated image on these criteria:

#### ‚úÖ **Realism Indicators (Good)**
- Natural skin texture with subtle imperfections
- Realistic lighting and shadows
- Natural facial expressions
- Proper proportions and anatomy
- Authentic human micro-expressions
- Film grain or subtle noise (looks photographed)
- Natural eye reflections and catchlights
- Realistic hair texture and flow

#### ‚ùå **AI Artifacts (Bad)**  
- Overly smooth or plastic-looking skin
- Perfect symmetry (humans aren't perfectly symmetric)
- Unrealistic lighting or shadows
- Digital artifacts or pixelation
- Over-saturated colors
- Unnatural poses or expressions
- Missing or extra facial features
- Artificial-looking eyes

### **Optimal Settings Discovery**

Use the validation workflows to find your persona's optimal settings:

1. **LoRA Strength Testing**: Try 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75
2. **Sampler Comparison**: DPM++ 2M SDE vs DPM++ 2M vs Euler A
3. **CFG Scale Testing**: 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0
4. **Step Count Optimization**: 35, 40, 45, 50

### **Pro Validation Tips**

- **Use fixed seeds** for fair comparison between methods
- **Generate in batches** of 4-6 images to see consistency
- **Test with different prompts** (portrait, candid, professional)
- **Upscale the best results** for final output quality
- **Document successful settings** for future use

## üé® **Professional Photography Prompts**

For maximum realism, use these advanced prompts:

```bash
# Portrait photography
"award-winning portrait of {trigger_word}, professional headshot, natural lighting, Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, shallow DOF, authentic expression"

# Environmental portraits  
"environmental portrait of {trigger_word}, natural habitat, photojournalism style, National Geographic, natural lighting, documentary photography"

# Studio photography
"studio portrait of {trigger_word}, professional lighting setup, medium format camera, Hasselblad, commercial photography, high-end retouching"

# Candid photography
"candid photograph of {trigger_word}, street photography, natural moment, 35mm film, grain, authentic expression, unposed"
```

Remember: **Quality over quantity** - it's better to have fewer high-quality, diverse training images than many similar ones.
